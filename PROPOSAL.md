# description

We are going to put an existing web application that we developed in "UE Multimediasysteme" into the cloud.
This application is called flou and serves as a focus dashboard in the web. It consists of a SvelteKit frontend, a Spring Boot Backend and a PostgreSQL database.

We are planning to containerize the frontend and backend of this application using Docker, orchestrate them using Kubernetes and deploy on GCP/Azure. //TODO
The Docker images will be uploaded to DockerHub.
Furthermore, we are going to implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions to allow for fast deployment.
